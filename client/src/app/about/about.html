      <div class="col-md-10">
        <p>As experienced travelers ourselves, we started Plansify in order to connect those in need of real travel advice with actual travel experts who can provide the most reliable, specific and personalized travel advice possible. Why rely on outdated
          sources of travel information when you can connect directly with an experienced traveler?</p>

        <p>Whether you need assistance creating an itinerary for Central America or you're looking for a perfect honeymoon destination in Asia... there is a Plansify travel advisor who can assist. If you're searching for ways to earn money overseas or you
          need advice on how to volunteer in Africa or how to travel on a budget throughout Australia...our experts are ready to guide you. The point is, Plansify works for absolutely any travel-related questions you may have! </p>

        <p>The reason for this is that our travel advisors are actually doing the very things, living in the very places and experiencing the very situations that you want to know about. Each advisor is a genuine expert in one or more aspects of travel and/or
          destinations and in just a few clicks, you can tap straight into their bank of valuable knowledge. You even get to choose how you want to communicate with an advisor - either by submitting your questions through our Plansify question form or
          through a 1 hour Skype call.</p>

        <p>As a result, the days of general, outdated, impersonal advice are over.</p>

        <p>The days of quick, reliable, personal travel advice have just begun... allowing you to easily gain the confidence needed to move forward with your travel plans, to achieve any of your travel goals and to simply, travel wiser.</p>
